# The Odin Project: Building with Responsive Design

In this project, we build a responsive clone of The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

3 viewports available:

- Small (max-width: 768px)
- Medium (min-width: 768px and max-width: 1024px)
- Large (min-width: 1024px)
